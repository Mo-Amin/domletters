putting my bread in the oven," went on Mrs. Baggert, the housekeeper,
"and I was so startled that I dropped it, and now the dough is all over
the kitchen floor. I never saw such a mess." (47)

"I'm sorry," answered the youth, trying not to laugh. "We'll see that

"Come on back, and we'll see what damage was done," proposed Tom.
"Maybe we can rig up another container, mix some fresh gas, and make
the final experiment this afternoon." (26)

"Now do be careful," cautioned Mr. Swift, the aged inventor, once more.
"I'm afraid you two have set too hard a task for yourselves this time." (21)
