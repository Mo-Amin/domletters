# domletters â€” count dominant letters
Mohamed-Amin Cheaito and Bart Massey 2021

This repository contains a program that counts dominant
letters in alphabetic words of an ASCII text read from
standard input, printing the total count on standard output.

An "alphabetic word" is any sequence of one or more
ASCII letters (`a`-`z` and/or `A`-`Z`) surrounded by
whitespace. For example

    This isn't an "incomplete sentence". Really
    not.

contains just three words: `This`, `an` and `Really`.

The "dominant letter count" of a word is the maximum number of
times that a given letter appears in the word, treating
upper and lowercase letters as equivalent. Examples:

* The dominant letter count of `any` is 1, since the most any
  letter appears is once.

* The dominant letter count of `bookkeeper` is 3, since `e`
  appears three times.

* The dominant letter count of `Arable` is 2, since `a`
  appears twice (once uppercase, once lowercase).

## Build and Run

To build the program, type `make`. This will use the file
named `Makefile` to compile the program.

To run the program once it is built, say

    ./domletters <input.txt

where `input.txt` is the input file to be processed.

## Example

When run using the file `sentence.txt` in this distribution,
the program will produce a dominant letter count of 20. When
run on `swift.txt` it will produce 71.


test.txt will produce 84
test2.txt will produce 140

For both of these tests I hand checked and it matched the program. For each
paragraph within test txt files I added the dominant letter count to the side
(Shouldn't alter answer).

I couldn't recall how to read a text file from standard input, so I had to use
[stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25985639/passing-text-file-to-standard-input).

## Brief Explanation of Solution

The main gist of my solution is that I go through each letter within the file
and once I reach a space character I consider that as an evaluation/reset point.
As I am checking each letter, I have a flag and if it continues to meet the
alphabetical word requirements it remains true otherwise it turns false. If the flag is true and the letter is
alphabetical I add that letter to the vector and keep ahold of it as I may need
to do more with it later. Once I reach a space and the flag is still true then we had
an alphabetic word and need to account for the dominant letter and add its
occurences. However if we reach a space and the flag was false then we have an
improper word and we just reset the flag and get ready for the next word. No matter the 
value of the flag we clear the vector so we can repeat this process for the next word.
